<p>
  I am a undergraduate student at ZJU, majoring in mathematics and working with professor Wang Feng and Jiang Wenshaui.
  I would receive a Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences in June 2019. I am also a member of <a herf="http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/english/"> Chu Kochen Honors College</a> 
  at Zhejiang University.
</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems.
The real excitement of this area comes from what can enable
when we bring advanced learning techniques and system together.
On that end, I am also pushing the direction on deep learning,
knowledge transfer and lifelong learning.</br></p>

<p>
Recently, I am working on <a href="https://tvm.ai">TVM stack</a>.
Together with collaborators from <a href="https://sampl.cs.washington.edu">SAMPL Lab</a>,
we co-design systems, machine learning algorithms, architecture,
and programming language to enable future intelligent systems.
</p>

<p>
I build machine learning systems that are widely adopted.
Besides TVM, the two other noticable ones are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://xgboost.ai"> XGBoost</a>, a scalable tree boosting system. </br>
    It is one of the de-facto tools used by data scientists daily.
    You can find it in the production pipelines of the many major companies such as
    Uber, Airbnb, Amazon and Google Cloud.
    It has also been used to predict interesting physics events in LHC.
  <li> <a href="https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/">Apache MXNet</a>(co-creator) </br>
    One of the major deep learning frameworks, it is currently adopted by AWS.
</ul>

<p>
I am graduating in 2019, and am on the job market this year.
