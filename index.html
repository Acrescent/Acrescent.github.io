<p>
  I am a undergraduate student at ZJU, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.
  I am also a member of <a href="http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/english/">Chu Kochen Honors College</a> 
  at ZJU. I would receive my Bachelor's Degree of Natural Sciences in June 2019.
</p>

<h2>Study and Research</h2>
<p>
I am interested in Geometry and Topology, Partial Differential Equations and Analysis,
Representation theory and Lie algerba, Lie Groups.
</p>

<p>
In my undergraduate study, I spent the first two years on equations
and analysis. When I was a junior student, I visited <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> and took graduate level courses about Riemann geometry, geometry analysis, algebraic topology and Lie 
groups, which are all exciting things for me. This summer, I visited professor <a href="http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk/leung/">Naichung Conan Leung</a>
at <a href="http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>
at <a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, studied things about differential forms in algebraic topology and Morse theory.
</br></p>

<p>
Recently, I am working with professor<a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0014136">Wang Feng</a> and <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wsjiang">Jiang Wenshuai</a> about the differential sphere theorem and Gromov compactness theorem.
And I am participating in a seminar about graduate level Lie algebra and Riemann Surfaces. My bachelor thesis would focus on the differential sphere theorem.
